<h1 id='h1_blog'>Hit the Ground and Run</h1>

<p>I write to you, friends, from an island just south of the Bering Sea.</p>

<p>Originally, I was supposed to get out here by means of a ferry that only runs during the summer, once every two weeks. However, ferry service was cancelled for most of the season due to delayed repairs. I was pretty disappointed to learn that I'd have to fly out instead, but the flight ended up having its own perks as well, including unlimited free snacks, a close encounter with a mountain during our descent, and a nice view of Pavlof Volcano on the Alaska Peninsula. Pavlof has been erupting for over a month now and wreaking minor havoc on local communities and regional air traffic.</p>

<p>Today was my first day at KUCB (it's official). Here's the building that the station is housed in, with my trusty mountain bike, on loan, parked out front.</p>

 <p>Don't let the flora in this picture fool you -- most of Unalaska is tundra. KUCB appears to be surrounded by some of the only trees on the entire island, which makes it a popular spot for the island's local bald eagles to hang out. Today I looked up from my desk and noticed a bald eagle sitting outside in a tree no more than ten feet from me. There are an estimated 1,000 bald eagles in Unalaska (compare that to the 4,000 permanent human residents), which explains why there are so many eagle-related incidents every year. They've even drawn the attention of National Geographic, which has a crew out here right now doing a feature on the birds.</p>

 <p>Today I was sent out on my very first assignment: to tour the USCGC Polar Star, the U.S.'s only heavy icebreaker, which has been docked in Dutch Harbor for several days on its way up from Seattle (!!!) to the Arctic. After a brief primer on KUCB's recording equipment and U.S. Coast Guard ranks (commander before lieutenant, ensign before petty officer), I found myself teetering on the crow's nest of a ship, conducting my first real radio interview. It was a bewildering experience -- how are you supposed to shake hands with someone while holding a recorder, a shotgun mic, a camera, and headphones? -- but also incredibly engaging and, dare I say it, fun. Talk about hitting the ground running.</p>

<p>My story is set to air tomorrow at noon, which is both horrifying (I haven't finished writing the script yet) and exciting (I'm going to be heard on statewide radio? Really?!). I can already tell that I'll be learning a ton while I'm here, although that's really just a clever way of saying that I don't know anything yet. But even though today could have been overwhelming, somehow it wasn't, and I can't say that I'd rather be doing anything else right now. I'll take that as a good sign.</p>

<p>I've had time to begin exploring the island and have already noticed several apparent contradictions (e.g. a sushi restaurant, two post offices, and an indoor track at the community center, but no reliable cell phone service or internet). However, I'll save my musings on that, as well as more photos of Unalaska, for another day. </p>
