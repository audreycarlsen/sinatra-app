<h1 class='h1_blog'>Week Three</h1>

<p>This week we had our first one-on-one “check ins” with instructors. This was a great time to get some individual feedback, as well as to let the program directors know what was working and what wasn’t. I had a few suggestions to make the course even better - more assessments! fewer typos! - but it’s hard to criticize such an awesome program. I still can’t believe I’m getting to do this.</p>

<p>During my one-on-one, I was asked what I thought I was doing best, and what I thought I could still do better. Regarding where I’ve got room for improvement, I brought up my apprehensions about how I am doing in the class, if I’m doing enough work and whether I should be applying myself more. Ada has been a different sort of learning experience than any I’ve had before. Prior to starting at Ada, my most recent academic experience was a semester of medical school - a very stressful, high-intensity, all-encompassing experience. Personally, I was miserable, to the extent that I decided to leave medical school. However, things have been just the opposite at Ada. In fact, we hardly have any formal assessments at all, and when we do - i.e. morning “quizzes” - they serve more as a personal marker to gauge how we’re doing than as any sort of formal “grade.” This has allowed me to relax a little, and to learn in a much more effective way.</p>

<p>Of course, in comparison to my med school days, I sometimes worry that I am not working hard enough. But on the other hand, I am now enjoying a life-school balance that I’ve never managed to achieve before. And that’s what I described during my one-on-one as the thing I thought I was doing best – approaching this in a manageable way, and taking breaks and knowing when to step away from it when necessary. We’re all very competent in this class, and we all feel the drive to study as much as possible, to learn and understand everything presented in class, and even things beyond what is presented in class, but I’m happy to see that I’ve been able to keep that drive in check and take time to do other things, to remind myself that the world extends far beyond my computer screen.</p>

<p>The fact that I’ve managed to maintain a balanced life during these first three weeks of class highlights one of the things I find most appealing about this field - it offers the opportunity to do useful, stable work while also allowing for flexibility and an enjoyable, manageable lifestyle. So far, I’ve learned that I love to code, and that I also love to be able to walk away from my code, push it out of my mind at times, and enjoy other things as well.</p>

<p>This week involved several afternoons of extreme burnout - we were working on a weeklong project analyzing databases, and there’s only so many hours you can spend sitting in front of a computer, mulling over the same coding problems. But even in these moments of delirium, I didn’t feel stressed out. I felt challenged, I felt tired, but at no point did I want to run away screaming. And realizing that was the best thing that happened to me all week.</p>
